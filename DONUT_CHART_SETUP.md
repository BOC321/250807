## üéØ What the PDF Donut Chart Looks Like

Instead of a round donut (which doesn't work well in PDFs), you'll see:
- **Horizontal progress bars** for each category (colored by score ranges)
- **Circular "Total" badge** showing your overall percentage
- **Category names** with their individual percentages

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: "I don't see the Score Overview option"
**Solution**: Click the blue "Update Template" button first - this adds the new section to your template.

### Problem: "PDF still doesn't have the donut chart"
**Solutions**:
1. Make sure you clicked "Update Template" AND "Save"
2. Check that "Score Overview (visual chart)" is ‚úÖ checked
3. Try generating a new PDF report (old cached reports won't have it)

### Problem: "I can't find the PDF Report Designer"
**Navigation**:
- From Admin Dashboard ‚Üí look for "Reports" or "PDF Designer" 
- Or go directly to: `http://localhost:3001/admin/reports/designer`
