## Vercel Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Git repository set up
- Vercel account
- Supabase project created
- Gmail account with app password

### Environment Variables

Before deploying, you need to set up these environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# Gmail SMTP Configuration
GMAIL_EMAIL=your_gmail_address@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
```

### Deployment Steps

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**:

   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel**:

   ```bash
   cd survey-app
   vercel
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts**:
   - Set up your project name
   - Link to your Git repository (recommended)
   - Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard

5. **Environment Variables Setup**:
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add all the environment variables listed above

6. **Redeploy** (after adding environment variables):

   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Important Notes for Vercel Deployment

- **Puppeteer Configuration**: The app is configured to work with Puppeteer on Vercel serverless functions
- **Function Timeout**: The PDF generation function has a 30-second timeout configured
- **CORS Headers**: Proper CORS headers are set up for API routes
- **Build Optimization**: Next.js build optimizations are enabled for better performance

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. **Build Failures**: Check that all dependencies are properly installed
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set in Vercel
3. **Puppeteer Issues**: The configuration is optimized for Vercel's serverless environment
4. **Email Sending**: Verify Gmail SMTP credentials and ensure "Less secure app access" is enabled or use an app password

### Local Development

To run the application locally:

```bash
cd survey-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
